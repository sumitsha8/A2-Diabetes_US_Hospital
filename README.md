**INTERACTIVE DATA VISUALIZATION PROJECT ON DIABETES US HOSPITAL**

**ASSIGNMENT-2

MODULE: INTERACTIVE VISUALIZATION

**TOOLS FOR VISUALIZATION: PYTHON , JUPYTER NOTEBOOK**

**LIBRARIES : PANDAS, NUMPY, MATPLOTLIB , SEABORN**


**Dataset:  DIABETES US HOSPITAL**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The dataset represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. It includes over 50 features representing patient and hospital outcomes. Information was extracted from the database for encounters that satisfied the following criteria.
(1)	It is an inpatient encounter (a hospital admission).
(2)	It is a diabetic encounter, that is, one during which any kind of diabetes was entered to the system as a diagnosis.
(3)	The length of stay was at least 1 day and at most 14 days.
(4)	Laboratory tests were performed during the encounter.
(5)	Medications were administered during the encounter.
The data contains such attributes as patient number, race, gender, age, admission type, time in hospital, medical specialty of admitting physician, number of lab test performed, HbA1c test result, diagnosis, number of medication, diabetic medications, number of outpatient, inpatient, and emergency visits in the year before the hospitalization, etc.

**1.	Number of male and Females.**

 Comparing number of male and female diabetes patients. After performing data visualization operation we got that females are more affected by the diabetes in comparison to male. 

**2.	Patients from different Races.**

Now we are comparing number of diabetes patients belongs to different races. After getting results we can say that largest number of patients belongs to Caucasian and least number of patients belongs to Asians.
After performing data visualization on different age group, we get the following result. Highest number of diabetics patients are belongs to 70-80. In the ascending order, we can write it in the following order [1-10], [10-20], [20-30], [90-100], [30-40], [40-50], [50-60], [60-70], [80-90], [70-80].


**3.	Patiants by different age groups **

Now we have visualize data based on the type of admission of the patient get admitted in the hospital. In the dataset admission type Ids are given which represents different type of admission in the hospital. After visualization we can see that maximum number of patients are admitted in the hospital with emergency code.

**4.	Medical Speciality.** 

After visualization we get the following results.
1. 80% patients do not contain metformin.
2. 18% patients contain steady metformin.
3. 1% patients contain UP metformin.
4. 0.4%  patients contain DOWN metformin.


**5.	Metformin in patients.**

Bar chart represents the Metformin in Patients.

**6.	Repaglinide in Patients.**

Bar chart represents the Metformin in Patients.

**7.	Insulin in Patients.**

Following data visualization results represents percentage of patients changed or not changes after treatments.
1. 53.8% patients do not changed after treatment.
2. 46.2% patients changed after treatment.


**8.	Changes in Patients.**

Following data visualization results represents percentage of patients diabetes met after treatments.
1. 23% patients YES after treatment.
2. 77% patients No after treatment.


**9.	DiabetesMed.**

Patients who have more than 30% chances to readmit is 34.9%
Patients who have less than 30% chances to readmit is 11.1%
Patients who have NO chances to readmit is 53.9%
