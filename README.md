**INTERACTIVE DATA VISUALIZATION PROJECT ON DIABETES US HOSPITAL**

**ASSIGNMENT-2**

**MODULE: INTERACTIVE VISUALIZATION**

**TOOLS FOR VISUALIZATION: PYTHON , JUPYTER NOTEBOOK**

**LIBRARIES : PANDAS, NUMPY, MATPLOTLIB , SEABORN**

**Aim**
The aim of this project is become familiar with the visualization implementing techniques after exploring the issues involved in implementing interactive visualization.

**Vision**
As mentioned in the aim of his assignment i.e., to gain familiarity of implementing visualization techniques for which we need a datasource which can be used for visualization, we selected the database of diabetes patients in a hospital. This datasource helped in visualizing different types of data.
Data from this datasource is visualized in different manners in this assignment. As the datasource contains a number of patients’ details and it is an important information for people so we used to visualize data from this datasource. We used to visualize different dimensions of this data in the assignment for a better understanding of visualization techniques. 


**Dataset:  DIABETES US HOSPITAL**

This information has been set up to dissect components identified with readmission just as different results relating to patients with diabetes. 
The dataset speaks to certain long stretches of clinical consideration at various US medical clinics and incorporated conveyance systems.
It incorporates more than 50 highlights speaking to patient and medical clinic results. Data was removed from the database for experiences that fulfilled the accompanying criteria. 
(1)	It is an inpatient experience (an emergency clinic confirmation). 
(2)	It is a diabetic experience, that is, one during which any sort of diabetes was entered to the framework as a determination. 
(3)	The length of stay was in any event 1 day and at most 14 days. 
(4)	Laboratory tests were performed during the experience. 
(5)	Medications were controlled during the experience. 
The information contains such traits as patient number, race, sexual orientation, age, affirmation type, time in clinic, therapeutic claim to fame of conceding doctor, number of lab test performed, HbA1c test outcome, analysis, number of drug, diabetic prescriptions, number of outpatient, inpatient, and crisis visits in the year prior to the hospitalization, and so forth.

Data can be found on https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008#

**Requirements for developing the Visualizations**

Below are the tools used to develop the, reports, datasets, design diagrams and visualizations:
1.	Microsoft Word
2.	Microsoft Excel (.csv)
3.	Draw.io
4.	Python
5.	GitHub

**Data visualizations based on below analytical questions**:

1.	Number of Male and Female diabetes patients in US?

2.	Diabetes Patients from different Races?

3.	Diabetes Patients by different age groups?

4.	Patients attends by which medical specialist? 

5.	Metformin found the diabetics patients?

6.	Repaglinide percentage in patients?

7.	Insulin found the diabetics patients?

8.	Improvement after treatment in patients?

9.	Percentage of patient’s diabetes met after treatments

10.	Patients by admission types?

11.	Patients who have NO chances to readmit? 

12.	Report for different gradiant in blood sample of patients

** 1.	Number of Male and Female diabetes patients in US? **

Comparing number of male and female diabetes patients. After performing data visualization operation we got that females are more affected by the diabetes in comparison to male. Following graph is showing the comparison of male and female patients admitted in the hospital for their treatments. It shows that  mostly females are affected from diabetes. Graph is used for a better visualization of this comparison.

** 2.	Diabetes Patients from different Races? **

Now we are comparing number of diabetes patients belongs to different races. The patients admitted in the hospitals are from different races such as African, American, asian, Caucasian, Hispanic, unknown and others. But after getting results we can say that largest number of patients belongs to Caucasian and least number of patients belongs to Asians. According to the graph, patients who are most admitted in hospitals belonged to races African America and Caucasian. Even some of the patients were not recognized by their races so we mentioned one of the races’ categories as unknown. From this comparison we concluded that Caucasians are mostly get affected from diabetes.

** 3.	Diabetes Patients by different age groups?**

After performing data visualization on different age group, we get the following result. Highest number of diabetics patients are belonged to 70-80. In the ascending order, we can write it in the following order [1-10], [10-20], [20-30], [90-100], [30-40], [40-50], [50-60], [60-70], [70-80], [80-90].
To represent this comparison, we used to types graphs for better understanding and visualization. From both visualizations, it is represented that people after age 60 are mostly get affected from diabetes. The age group which is less affected from diabetes is 1-10 which includes infants and children.

** 4.	Patients attends by which medical specialist? ** 

Following graph, gives information about which patients attends by which medical specialist. There are different medical specialists who treated a number of diabetic patients such as endocrinology, Nephrology, odeopath and others. The results of this analysis are shown in the following graph. From this result it is concluded that most of the patients are treated through nephrology specialist.
After visualization we get the following results.
1. 80% patients do not contain metformin.
2. 18% patients contain steady metformin.
3. 1% patients contain UP metformin.
4. 0.4%  patients contain DOWN metformin.

** 5.	Metformin found the diabetics patients? **

Following pie graph gives information about how the metformin can be found the diabetics patients. After visualization we get the following results.
1. 80% patients do not contain metformin.
2. 18% patients contain steady metformin.
3. 1% patients contain UP metformin.
4. 0.4%  patients contain DOWN metformin.
For better visualization of these results we used pie chart. Pie chart is an effective way for representing data in percentage form as it uses to make different sections for representing different percentages. In the following pie chart, we included the percentage of metformin which is found in diabetic patients. From this analysis, we found that very less patients i.e., 0.4% contains metformin and most of the patients i.e., 80% do not contain metformin.

** 6.	Repaglinide percentage in patients? **

Following chart represents information of rapaglinide percentage in patients. From this analysis, we found that most of the diabetic patients i.e.,, 98.5% do not contain rapaglinide. We used a pie chart for representing his percentage also.

** 7.	Insulin found the diabetics patients? **

The followig graph is representing the ratio of insulin that we found in diabetc patients after analsis. From the following graph, it is clear that most of the patients do nt contain insulin. Many of patients are steady with containing insulin.
Improvement after treatment
Following data visualization results represents percentage of patients changed or not changes after treatments.
1. 53.8% patients do not changed after treatment.
2. 46.2% patients changed after treatment.
So it is clear that more than half patients have not recovered from their disease and only 46.2% patients have improved after treatment.

** 8.	Improvement after treatment in patients? **

Following data visualization results represents percentage of patients diabetes met after treatments.
1. 23% patients YES after treatment.
2. 77% patients No after treatment.

**9.	Percentage of patient’s diabetes met after treatments? **

Patients who have more than 30% chances to readmit is 34.9%
Patients who have less than 30% chances to readmit is 11.1%
Patients who have NO chances to readmit is 53.9%

** 10.   Patients by admission types? **

Now we have visualize data based on the type of admission of the patient get admitted in the hospital. In the dataset admission type Ids are given which represents different type of admissions in the hospital. After visualization we can see that maximum number of patients are admitted in the hospital with emergency code. It means that some people are getting highly affected from this disease and admitted in the hospital for urgent treatment. Man of the patients are also admitted in urgent code which means that they need to start their treatment on urgent bases so that this disease can not affect them highly.

** 11.	 Patients who have NO chances to readmit? **

Bar graph for comparing readmitted patients found in US.
